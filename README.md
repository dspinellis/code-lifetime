# Tools for tracking the lifetime of code lines and tokens
The tools in this repository allow the precise tracking of when a specific
code line or token is modified or removed.
They have been used for conducting the studies described in the
following paper.

This is the paper's abstract.

A model regarding the lifetime of individual source code lines or tokens can
estimate maintenance effort,
guide preventive maintenance, and,
more broadly,
identify factors that can improve the efficiency of software development.
We present methods and tools that allow tracking of
each line's or token's birth and death.
Through them, we analyze 3.3 billion source code element lifetime events
in 89 revision control repositories.
Statistical analysis shows that code lines are durable,
with a median lifespan of about 2.3 years,
and that young lines are more likely to be modified or deleted,
following a Weibull distribution
with the associated hazard rate decreasing over time.
This behavior appears to be independent from specific characteristics
of lines or tokens, as we could not determine factors that
influence significantly their longevity across projects.
The programming language,
and developer tenure and experience were not
found to be significantly correlated with line or token longevity,
while project size and project age showed only a slight correlation.

The following sections describe the tools included in this repository.

## lifetime
The _lifetime_ tool parses the output of successive _git diff_ runs and,
for every changed or deleted line, outputs a record containing the timestamps
of the line's creation and deletion.
Input can be supplied on its standard input or as files specified as arguments.
To monitor progress in long repositories it also outputs on its standard error
the SHA hash of each commit being processed.
When all commits have been processed it outputs the creation timestamps of
all remaining lines followed by `alive NA`.

### Example run

```
git log -M -m --pretty=tformat:'commit %H %ct' --topo-order --reverse -U0 |
lifetime.pl
1516281718 1597482365
1514636783 1597482365

1525764676 alive NA

1587747980 alive NA
1587747980 alive NA
1586362490 alive NA
1586362490 alive NA

```

The tool's operation can be modified through the following command-line
arguments.
```
-c      Output in "compressed" format: commit, followed by birthday of deaths
-d      Report the LoC delta
-D opts Debug as specified by the letters in opts
        C Show commit set changes
        D Show diff headers
        E Show diff extended headers
        H Show each commit SHA, timestamp header
        L Show LoC change processing
        P Show push to change set operations
        R Reconstruct the repository contents from its log
        @ Show range headers
        S Show results of splicing operations
        u Run unit tests
-e SHA  End processing after the specified (full) SHA commit hash
-E      Redirect (debugging) output to stderr
-g file Create a growth file with line count of live lines at every commit
-h      Print usage information and exit
-l      Associate with each line details about its composition
-q      Quiet; do not output commit and timestamp on normal processing
-s      Report only changes in source code files (based on their suffix)
-t      Show tokens with lifetime
```

## daglp
The _daglp_ program simplifies Git commit history into a linear graph
with the most commits, using a [graph longest path algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_path_problem#Acyclic_graphs_and_critical_paths).
Given as input a topologically sorted list of each commit's parents,
it will output the longest path of the directed acyclic graph from the
beginning (the oldest commit) to the end (the newest one).
The input is expected to come from a command such as
`git log --topo-order --pretty=format:'%H %at %P'`.
The output is a set of "SHA identifier" lines.

### Example run

```
$ git log --topo-order --pretty=format:'%H %at %P' | daglp
13af1997c687bb4462f97ab512e51e8c072a2858 1370686723
d8e85967adc0b188a49117b5db4f10cc6c7c36cb 1370688578
27a8ec806f16ae66a7eaa8563220f600c99b9ab9 1370688605
222f60c28228e189c0986f8c4e86cc5a07e69bfa 1370688896
a0759fa8d6838170e4b693d26d6edb5e0463c1d0 1370689181
```

## difflog
The _difflog_ tool produces a Git repository's log of changes
in unified diff format
This is the equivalent of running, as required by the _lifetime_ tool.

```
git -c diff.renameLimit=30000 log -m -M -C --pretty=tformat:'commit %H %at' --topo-order --reverse -U0
```

However, the former command [has been known to produce incorrect results](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/38839595/how-can-i-obtain-with-git-log-a-series-of-patches-that-can-be-auto-applied), which _difflog_ corrects.
Any command line options are passed as arguments to _git diff_.

## tokenize
The _tokenize_ tool is used to convert the source code commits of a Git
repository into equivalent ones containing one token per line, as e.g. proposed
by [cregit](https://github.com/cregit/cregit) and
[used on the Linux kernel](https://github.com/dmgerman/linux-token-bfg).
The new repository can then be used for performing token-level diffs.

The tool supports code written in Java, C, C#, C++, PHP, and Python,
as recognized by each file's suffix.
The tool expects the separate
[tokenizer](https://github.com/dspinellis/tokenizer) tool to be installed
and available in its execution path.
It is invoked with a Git repository directory and branch name as
argument.
Its output is suitable for feeding into _git fast-input_.
Each line in the new repository contains the token 's type
(KW for keyword,
NUM for number,
ID for identifier, and
TOK for all other tokens),
followed by the actual token.

### Example run
```
$ git init tokenized-repo
$ tokenize.pl repo main  | (cd tokenized-repo ; git fast-import)
